Connect to Cassandra Cluster:

    Use the cqlsh command-line tool to connect to the Cassandra cluster. This tool is usually included with Cassandra installations.
    Run cqlsh command in your terminal to start the cqlsh shell.

Create a Keyspace:

    Once connected to cqlsh, you can create a keyspace using CQL (Cassandra Query Language) commands. For example:

    sql

    CREATE KEYSPACE my_keyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};

Use the Keyspace:

    After creating the keyspace, switch to it using the USE command. For example:

    USE my_keyspace;

Create a Table:

    Create a table within the keyspace you've just created. Define the table schema according to your requirements. For example:

    sql

    CREATE TABLE my_table (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        name text,
        age int
    );

Insert Data:

    Insert some data into the table you've created. For example:

    sql

    INSERT INTO my_table (id, name, age) VALUES (uuid(), 'John', 30);

Query Data:

    Query the data you've inserted to verify that it's stored correctly. For example:

    sql

    SELECT * FROM my_table;

Verify Results:

    Verify that the data returned by the query matches the data you've inserted.

Exit cqlsh:
